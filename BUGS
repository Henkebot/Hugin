- photometric optimisation using multiple lenses does not work.


- trying to stitch a simple TIFF, I got "TIFFOpen error xxx.tif: cannot open" with nona and with PTstitcher the file
wasn't created and _PTStitcher_tmp_3 not deleted. Multiple TIFF with PTstitcher worked as expected but xxx3 has "unknown
field with tag 0x13d". Multiple layer PSD is not recognized as multilayed and tmp files, which are filled with blank,
are not deleted.

- when defining a pair of CPs, you cannot (A)dd it any more once it's been optimised. I don't see why it is so as this
is anyway an explicit command

- when changing zoom magnification, current image pair is not redrawn; you have to select another one

- the message in status bar "stitching/ rmapping" is not cleared after it is done

- "calculate field of view" must be clicked after each optimisation; an auto mode would be nice; same with pixel width

- The behaviour when clicking on the image is not clear to me: it seems there are two states, creation and modification.
I tried to select a point to move it but it added one instead and found immediatly its counterpart. As "auto-add" wasn't
selected, it did noithing else.
Then I switched to another page and came back. The two points were still displayed. I clicked somewhere and got that
message:
ERROR:  (CPImageCtrl.cpp:446) mouseMoveEvent(): mouse down movement without selection, in NO_SELECTION state!
WARN:  (CPImageCtrl.cpp:571) mouseReleaseLMBEvent(): mouse release without selection

yes - I get an error - ImageCache.cpp:181 getImage() Can't load image
F:\panoramy\polska\elk-kosciol\
this is directory where the project is - without the actual image file.

pts lines are:

This is what I've done

And this time I got an empty file with this name + the .tif file 8 byte long + 3
.tif files containing the multi-tif picture.

BTW : I'm using linux. And I've enblend in my path ...
