2008-03-14 08:50  dangelo

	* Moved matchpoint into main hugin tree. Fixed crash when computing
	  the descriptors.

2008-03-06 21:12  harryvanderwolf

	* when converting between 16 bit unicode and 8 bit strings, use

	  short of writing a own widget tailored to display this kind of
	  text.

2007-11-14 07:08  dangelo

2007-11-01 00:02  dangelo

	* wxProcess does not work in wxMSW as it works on Mac and Unix.
	  Output of the child process can't be captured, trying to use
	  a standard windows console to execute, but make.exe executes
	  without console, while autopano does.

2007-10-30 23:15  dangelo

	* Use wxInputStream::CanRead() instead of
	  wxProcess::IsInputAvailable() to check for output
	  from the child process. IsInputAvailable() uses polling and
	  consumes as much CPU as it can get.
	  Autopano run from within hugin should be twice as fast now.
	  Disabled running the programs in an external xterm.

2007-10-29 22:37  dangelo

	  things.
	  I haven't moved the mac directory there, because there might
	  be relative paths pointing to the hugin sources etc. in there.

2007-10-27 08:17  dangelo

	* fixed OpenEXR detection to deal with older, non threaded version
	  of OpenEXR

	* added initial russian translation by Alexandre Prokoudine

2005-06-14 17:15  ippei

	* Mac:wxMac patches recommended/needed for compiling HuginOSX. They
	  are submitted to wxWidgets sourceforge as well.

2005-06-14 16:56  ippei

	* Updated mac documents in text format

2005-06-14 16:41  ippei

	* Japanese localisation :)

2005-06-13 10:51  ippei

	* Mac: renew config.h from the newest .in

2005-06-11 20:39  ippei

	* Using plain text instead in order to ease the version controling.
	  OSX style bundle files do not work very well with cvs, especially
	  with sourceforge's configuration.

2005-06-11 09:50  ippei

	* Mac: removing the border around mainframe tab.

2005-06-11 09:43  ippei

	* Mac: fix font size to system default

2005-06-10 23:12  ippei

	* Saving the column width of image/control point lists.

2005-06-10 22:50  ippei

	* Changing English "Projection" to "projection" in Stitcher panel
	  so that it matches with other labels spelled in lower case.

2005-06-10 13:27  ippei

	* fixed the problem with roll being reset and real time update of
	  the lines

2005-06-10 09:02  ippei

	* Mac's column size work around

2005-06-09 22:54  ippei

	* widen the first column 10 pixel as it was smaller than enough for
	  2 digits on Mac.

2005-06-09 22:45  ippei

	* Mac: Dropping support for Internal autopano-sift script +
	  External autopano-sift executables. Now the options are 1. both
	  internal or 2. specifying working script that already has the
	  path of autopano-sift set with either paths starting with / or
	  ~/, or through system's search path. In other words, users have
	  to choose either "dead easy but may not work", or "should work if
	  you set up properly".

2005-06-09 22:37  dangelo

	* made compression choice smaller

2005-06-09 22:35  dangelo

	* changed "pixel width" to width.

2005-06-09 22:28  dangelo

	* only specify complete font for headings on the mac.

2005-06-09 21:20  dangelo

	* fixed sorting of images on add.

2005-06-09 20:35  dangelo

	* updated xrc files for wxWindows 2.4. Should look similar, but
	  without support
	  for scrolling on small screens and splitter windows.

2005-06-09 20:33  dangelo

	* slightly better grouping

2005-06-09 13:09  ippei

	* Making appearance similar to Stitcher panel (just deleting custom
	  option label)

2005-06-09 13:09  ippei

	* Spacing fix

2005-06-09 09:55  ippei

	* The sorting was defined somewhere else. Sorry...

2005-06-09 05:52  dangelo

	* bugfix: added missing break; that resulted in an error message
	  when psd output
	  was chosen

2005-06-08 21:27  dangelo

	* updated translations to include *-2.5.xrc files, translated move
	  up/down into french,
	  and added projection to polish translation.

2005-06-08 20:36  dangelo

	* Made layout more consistent, by moving h/vfov and projection type
	  to the top,
	  kind of "important" panorama options. I believe the layout is
	  kind of
	  conistent and should not be changed substatially before 0.5.
	  Also made some small changes to the spacing.

2005-06-08 20:33  dangelo

	* added space before compression selection spinbox

2005-06-08 20:28  dangelo

	* made ptstitcher panel look similar to nona panel

2005-06-08 17:04  ippei

	* Moving enblend click box to output file section. This is a
	  minimum change to fix the strange grouping of this panel, but if
	  not appropriate, probably it's a good idea to reverse this
	  change.

2005-06-08 17:03  ippei

	* Putting field of view out from the custom options and moving
	  projection setting into this section. This is a minimum change to
	  fix the strange grouping of this panel, but if not appropriate,
	  probably it's a good idea to reverse this change.

2005-06-08 16:51  ippei

	* Removing labels seems meaningless.

2005-06-08 16:48  ippei

	* fixing min size of the tabs which was smaller than Mac's widget
	  size.

2005-06-08 16:00  ippei

	* Spacing improvements

2005-06-08 15:44  ippei

	* Changed the sizer order from horizontal under vertical to
	  vertical under horizontal, and moved add and delete button so
	  that the window can get smaller without scrolls than before. Add
	  button also became more accessible, and everything you use when
	  adding points manually got together in the right hand side.

2005-06-08 15:18  ippei

	* Back ground colour of some widgets that look strange on Mac. I
	  hope I'm not breaking anything on other platforms.

2005-06-08 15:08  ippei

	* Balanced the spacing a little bit. It's not excellent yet, but I
	  stop here for now.

2005-06-08 14:44  ippei

	* Spacing fix for below the small lables

2005-06-08 14:33  ippei

2005-06-08 12:02  ippei

	* adding space to top edge as well

2005-06-08 11:23  ippei

	* Sorting when multiple images are being added

2005-06-08 06:06  dangelo

	* added 6 pixels space between wxSplitter and top level group
	  titles
	  looks good on win and gtk

	* Spacing fix

2005-06-08 00:04  ippei

	* better fix of spacing

	  don't need separate xrc files.

2005-06-02 15:01  ippei

	* Mac: The choices too should be disabled if there are no images

2005-06-02 07:55  dwilkins42

	* Ensure pano12.dll can be queried on windows

2005-06-02 07:50  dwilkins42

	  images

2005-05-18 06:31  dangelo

	  changing the structure at the moment.

2005-05-17 19:10  ippei

	  and photoshop output is selected.

2005-05-17 19:06  ippei

	* Mac: Putting PTOptimizer inside the application bundle. I can do
	  this to enblend and autopano-sift as well. What do you think?

	  the project on which hugin's functionality is wholely depended.)

2005-05-17 19:01  ippei

	* Mac: Let hugin respond to file opening AppleEvent so that users

2004-09-12 21:33  dangelo

	* Fix for compilation with gcc 3.4, thanks to Douglas Wilkins

2004-09-08 23:33  dangelo

	* simple test tool to undistort images according to the zhang
	  camera model.
	  an opensource calibration tool is available from
	  http://www.loper.org/~matt/CamChecker/CamChecker_docs/html/index.html

2004-09-08 23:13  dangelo

	* Fixes for Mac OSX compilation. Thanks to Ippei UKAI for the
	  activity on the Mac

2004-09-08 22:55  dangelo

	* minor change

2004-09-08 22:52  dangelo

2004-09-08 22:04  dangelo

	* minor changes (DEBUG output etc.)

2004-09-08 22:03  dangelo

	* added window to display the magnified and perspetive corrected
	  control points.
	  DISABLED, because of a bug in the orientation estimation.

2004-09-08 21:59  dangelo

	* added some test that compare the two correlation routines

2004-09-08 21:59  dangelo

	* abort building after a compiler error has occured.

2004-09-08 21:57  dangelo

	* better output parsing of PTStitcher and PTOptimizer (optimizing
	  progress works properly with newer Pano Tools library)

2004-09-08 21:56  dangelo

	* removed stupid cut'n'paste error that created the nona output
	  files before the stitching.
	  This broke nona stitching if the correct file extension was
	  specified.

2004-09-08 21:54  dangelo

	* added new correlation function that will also search for rotated
	  patches.
	  it must be enabled in the config file (or registry), by setting
	  CPEditorPanel/RotationSearch = 1
	  the angle interval that should be tried can be specified with
	  
	  CPEditorPanel/RotationStartAngle
	  CPEditorPanel/RotationStopAngle

2004-09-08 21:22  dangelo

	* fixed error when the path to an output file contained a .

2004-08-30 22:58  dangelo

	* fix endless loop on removing images, looks like an unsigned int
	  can get
	  negative with the gcc 3.3 under linux, that is (! (uint >= 0))
	  can become
	  true..

2004-08-30 07:38  dangelo

	* fixed a typo (file dialog was called save instead of load)

2004-08-29 23:48  dangelo

	* fixed error on enblend execution on unix. wxExecute doesn't like
	  quoted commands, like "enblend"

2004-08-27 22:51  dangelo

	* revert stupid change

2004-08-27 22:50  dangelo

	  c:\hugin_*.txt

2004-08-24 06:27  dangelo

	* removed debug output

2004-08-18 21:28  dangelo

	* subpixel accurate fine tune (for image pairs without rotation,
	  the accuracy should be between 0.1 and 0.2 pixels).

2004-08-18 21:25  dangelo

	* Enabled autopano button, even if no, or only one image is
	  selected. All
	  Images are used then. Same with Delete Control Points Button.

2004-07-30 05:56  dangelo

	* temporarily fixed abort when images are completely out of the
	  pano.
	  this should fix the annoying precondition messages on the preview
	  window

2004-07-30 05:52  dangelo

	* report if an image file could not be found

2004-07-30 05:51  dangelo

	* removed assertation of not all image parameters could be read.
	  hmm, strange this shouldn't happen, and is definately a problem,
	  but for the time beeing I just print something to the console.

2004-07-28 06:50  dangelo

	* commented out work in progress (subpixel estimation)

2004-07-28 05:53  dangelo

	* update for windows compilation using native mingw, undef's some
	  stupid macros defiend by windows, that mess up the compilation.
	  
	  All wxWindows includes have to be included in panoinc_WX.h, and
	  not
	  later.

2004-07-28 05:49  dangelo

	* added separate class of autopano on windows (works now...)

2004-07-21 21:41  dangelo

	* tried to fix autopano calling on windows, support for
	  autopano.kolor.com 1.03,
	  more warning messages if calling failed

2004-07-21 21:39  dangelo

	* preparations for subpixel finetuneing (and maybe editing)

2004-07-20 20:16  dangelo

	* added small nonzero defaults for a,b,c, else optimising will not
	  change them

2004-07-16 06:28  dangelo

	* warn if command line is > 2000 chars on windows

2004-07-16 06:17  dangelo

	* call enblend with -v option, so that the people see what is going
	  on

2004-07-16 06:17  dangelo

	* delete autopano result file

2004-07-15 23:00  dangelo

	* - last update broke autopano result reading.. changed result
	  filename.

2004-07-15 22:49  dangelo

	* - assume t0 points if type is not specified in optimizer script
	  (work around autopano 1.3 bugs)

2004-07-15 22:47  dangelo

	* - also quote autopano and enblend filenames
	  - assume t0 points if type is not specified in optimizer script

2004-07-12 21:45  dangelo

	* uses standart wxCursor on __WXMAC__

2004-07-11 21:36  dangelo

	* added "Add" button, and dynamic dis/enableing of add and delete
	  buttons.

2004-07-11 15:03  dangelo

	* fixed some crashes:
	  - crash when selecting point outside image
	  - crash when seleciing a point in the listview while only 1 point
	  is set in the image
	  
	  some consistency changes:
	  - consistent coloring when setting points
	  (red: modify existing point, yellow, edit new point)
	  - made active point slightly bigger
	  - circles scale up when using zoom > 100%

2004-07-11 13:27  dangelo

	* remove images from cache, if an image is removed

2004-07-09 14:32  dangelo

	* avoid crash on destruction, or reload of new image

2004-07-07 22:09  dangelo

	* forgot include.. strange, compiled well on my system, but broke
	  on gcc 3.4

2004-07-07 22:08  dangelo

	* added a faster simple, copy ontop of eachother stitcher, for use
	  in
	  the preview panel. Should be a lot faster than the old solution.
	  Not
	  tested well yet..

2004-07-06 21:53  dangelo

	* added remap cache, speeds up preview panel A LOT
	  the better seam line calculation still takes a lot of time..
	  should offer a "quick mode" that just copies
	  the images over eachother.

2004-07-06 20:57  dangelo

	* default to TMPDIR, fallback to /tmp on unix.
	  does not save TMPDIR automatically, that is reads the TMPDIR
	  variable on every start, if the used didn't specify the
	  tempDir
	  in .huginrc

2004-07-06 04:29  dangelo

	* applied gcc 2.4 fixes by Douglas Wilkins
	  namespace fixes, and bugfixes for vigra
	  
	  03-vigra-update.patch.bz2 - two mistakes in vigra that are caught
	  by the
	  newer compiler. (corrections from latest mandrake vigra package)
	  04-vigra-namespace.patch.bz2 - explicit namespace declarations
	  required
	  by 3.4.1
	  05-hugin-fix1.patch.bz2 - remove dead code (never called) which
	  has an
	  undeclared variable "s"
	  06-hugin-move.patch.bz2 - move code so that forward declarations
	  are not
	  required
	  07-hugin-namepace.patch.bz2 - explicit namespace declarations
	  required
	  by 3.4.1

	  selected..

2004-07-03 09:41  dangelo

	* small changes

2004-07-03 08:11  dangelo

	* interface script for autopano-sift, that makes parameters
	  accessible
	  by the command line. Used by the new hugin autopano calling code
	  
	  Somebody should write a windows equivalent.

2004-07-03 07:59  dangelo

	* add " " around filenames. don't know how to quote " itself on
	  windows,
	  assumed ^ is the quote char. Maybe its wrong. but who would put a
	  " in
	  his filename.. ;)

2004-07-03 07:56  dangelo

	* test for new import_export routines

2004-07-02 21:02  dangelo

	* moved vigra_impex2 back into vigra namespace.
	  I hope that sometime the changes will end up in the official
	  vigra.
	  Until that happens I'll keep all stuff in the hugin cvs.
	  
	  This als means, that hugin does not depend on vigra packages
	  anymore!

2004-07-02 20:48  dangelo

	* disable buttons on automatic modes

2004-07-02 20:40  dangelo

2004-06-30 22:16  dangelo

	* use 4 digits for all multiimage outputs..

2004-06-30 22:08  dangelo

	* keep remapped source images for enblend in output directory, for
	  later patching.

2004-06-30 22:05  dangelo

	* use autopano-sift instead of autopano.exe, due to inconvinient
	  cmd
	  line usage and better matching results..
	  
	  I should write suitable wrapper scripts for unix and windows..

2004-06-30 10:47  dangelo

	* uses ADOBE_DEFLATE compression for all TIFF files
	  use 4 numeric digits for multiple file sequence numbering

2004-06-30 07:48  dangelo

	* uses standart crosshair cursor under win32, until custom cursor
	  works.
	  started work on stitcher presets, but not finished and enabled.

2004-06-29 21:43  dangelo

	* added working enblend option.
	  
	  The external autopano doesn't work on windows yet.. have to write
	  wrappers for
	  the different command line parameters.
	  
	  autopano/enblend will have problems with spaces in the
	  filenames.. have
	  to fix this sometime.

2004-06-29 20:06  dangelo

	* fixed permanent remapping.
	  removed image loading from the stitcher algo, moved into
	  a separate remapper class, useful for the preview, where
	  the remapped images can be cached..
	  
	  The drawback: That cache is not implemented yet :(

2004-06-29 20:03  dangelo

	* moved into vigra patch

	* new patch, includes the unsigned versions of most standart image
	  types

2004-06-15 16:37  dangelo

	* used 32 bit even for some fields that have been declared as
	  size_t in
	  the original source code. This is probably a bad hack.

2004-06-14 21:26  dangelo

	* added signedness to vigra typetraits

2004-06-13 22:34  dangelo

	* fixes for unix compilation

	* rc file for nona_gui

2004-06-13 13:48  dangelo

	* windows compilation working again.
	  Configuration: wxWindows 2.5.2 and mingw crosscompiler under
	  linux

2004-06-12 20:41  dangelo

	* removed obselete class, use vigra::BasicImageView instead

2004-06-10 17:35  dangelo

	* support for .cxx extension

2004-06-10 17:32  dangelo

	* *** empty log message ***

2004-06-10 17:30  dangelo

	* some attempts at using libtiff directly. still used for
	  multilayer files, but for
	  single layer files, impex2 provides a better alternative.

2004-06-10 17:29  dangelo

	* use impex2

2004-06-10 17:25  dangelo

	* bugfix

2004-06-10 17:22  dangelo

	* added Accessors to access an image with a separate alpha channel,

	* - remapping with alpha channel support (ignore pixels with
	  alpha=0 in source image)
	  - changes to the lens reading
	  - method to calculate stitching order based on size of overlaping
	  area.
	  - stitcher classes for remapping, multilayer tiff output, and
	  stitching
	  using a transition line calculated by Andrew's nearest feature
	  transform.
	  Should be more memory efficient, since it only keeps one image in
	  memory.
	  
	  Bugs:
	  - no feathering supported, still needs a lot of RAM. enblend
	  integration missing.

2004-06-08 21:10  dangelo

	* patched copy of vigra's impex with the following additions:
	  
	  - support for reading of images with alpha channel (only tiff &
	  png)

	  buggy.
	  - support for unsigned integer images.
	  - support for layer positions in tiff & png
	  - support for reading / writing of resolution tag (tiff & png)
	  
	  note: this depends on a slightly patched vigra. (type traits that
	  indicate the
	  signeness of integral types are needed).

2004-06-08 21:06  dangelo

	* functions to strip path and extensions

2004-06-08 21:02  dangelo

	* patched copy of vigra's impex with the following additions:
	  
	  - support for reading of images with alpha channel (only tiff &

	  - moved PTools interpolators here
	  - ported nearest feature transform from enblend
	  - added simple blending (no soft featering yet) based on the

	  this is far from perfect, each image from ptassember scripts will
	  get its
	  own lens. The file formats are just ugly.

2003-11-25 16:27  dangelo

	* - create valid output filenames, shouldn't add features without

	  images
	  or multiple images are selected
	  
	  - tried to fix the "remove last image" bug but didn't find the
	  right
	  solution here; hope I didn't make it worse

2003-11-18 04:39  speare

	* - new toolbar bitmap artwork which matches gtk2 ximian style and
	  ties into the panorama druid color/motifs for some orientation
	  
	  - will remove unused .xpm files soon if nobody claims them
	  
	  - reworded toolbar tooltips and statusbar help texts for
	  consistency
	  
	  - fixed typo in the About Hugin html

2003-11-18 00:07  dangelo

	  - added code to write the borders to a file, but doesn't work
	  yet.

	* small script to package the current cvs into a tar ball on
	  hugin.sf.net

2003-11-16 16:03  dangelo

	* - jpg quality was not honoured by PTSticher for progressive jpg
	  output.
	  disabled progressive jpg creation

2003-11-16 14:48  dangelo

	* - calculate correct sensor width/height even if the images have
	  been
	  rotated with jpgtran.
	  - precondition: sensor width > sensor height.. hmm. probably not
	  so nice.

2003-11-16 14:47  dangelo

	* - no functional changes, should add check if a new lens should be
	  added

2003-11-16 14:45  dangelo

2003-11-16 14:31  dangelo

	* - removed lens nr druid hint. its a program error to have images
	  without lens
	  - changed control point hint to consider 1 image panos as a
	  special case
	  - added hint to run the optimizer (detected if all images are
	  still at 0,0,0)

2003-11-16 13:50  dangelo

	* - fixed a crash if the estimated position was outside of the
	  image

2003-11-16 13:48  dangelo

	* changed focal length handling.
	  - crop factor is calculated based on sensor diagonals..
	  its a bit strange that my camera EXIF data reports non
	  square pixels...
	  
	  - changes to lens variables are applied to all images.

2003-11-16 01:17  speare

	* - added druid logic for NO_PLUMB_GUIDES, FEW_GUIDES,
	  UNGUIDED_IMAGE
	  - tried a better determination for HUGE_FINAL:
	  if the final image is more than 400 megapixels, or
	  if the final image has more pixels than all source images
	  combined;
	  would still like to determine available memory somehow

2003-11-14 10:54  dangelo

	* include files in include/pano12

2003-11-14 10:48  dangelo

	* stronger suggestion to use max lyons version of panorama tools

2003-11-11 07:08  dangelo

	* send panoramaChanged when dirty flag is reset

2003-11-11 03:54  speare

	* - reworked PanoDruid into its own class so it's easy to move
	  somewhere else
	  - reworked how Druid hints database is built, using goofy #define
	  tricks,
	  not a perfect scheme, but keeps strings and code organized
	  together
	  - added a couple new Druid hints, and more placeholders
	  - made pano.isDirty() a const member function

2003-11-10 23:15  dangelo

	* - warning if optimized v < 1 degree.
	  - better vfov/hfov calculation, but height calculation for
	  rectilinear and
	  cylindrical panos still wrong.
	  - focal length of portrait images should be handled well now.

2003-11-10 01:42  speare

	* - launches stitcher process at higher niceness on unixen;
	  should have no effect if user is drinking coffee, but will be
	  nicer
	  if the user is multitasking elsewhere.

2003-11-09 10:59  dangelo

	* - removed assertation in preview window
	  - added plotting of outlines
	  - added a 1 degree limit for HFOV/VFOV
	  - added Ed to the about tab

2003-11-09 00:24  dangelo

	* stuff needed for win

2003-11-09 00:16  dangelo

	* - changed repaint behaviour of CPImageCtrl. hopefully it works on
	  Win9X now...
	  - made fit to window the default

2003-11-08 23:26  dangelo

	* also missing in pano12.dll

2003-11-08 23:04  dangelo

	* fixed a warning

2003-11-08 23:03  dangelo

	* - FDiff2D -> Diff2D

2003-11-08 23:03  dangelo

	* - small python hack to convert PTAssember (V1.x) files to .pto
	  files
	  readable by hugin

2003-11-08 23:01  dangelo

	* - quick hack test cases, for the transform and remap stuff
	  not very nice

2003-11-08 22:59  dangelo

	* - keys 1 and 0 set 100% or fit to window zoom mode
	  - hopefully better handling of the input fields.
	  now enter will apply the settings, as does tab or a mouseclick
	  somewhere else. There are still some uneeded updates, but it
	  should be more reliable than before
	  - change default image cache limit to 100 MB

2003-11-08 22:54  dangelo

	* - added missing SetCorrectionRadius function
	  (isn't included in pano12.dll, but in libpano12.so, very strange)
	  
	  - Transform interface also support a version that can convert
	  from/to image coords.
	  - Added my own remapping function, that only uses the pano tool
	  coordinate transform
	  functions. works with all image types supportable by vigra.
	  - calculation of image border & remapped image roi. could be
	  improved for images
	  going over the edges.

2003-11-06 01:50  speare

	* - another iteration to tweak the interfaces of optimizer and pano
	  panels

2003-11-05 02:51  speare

	* - fixed minimum size for the anchor_orientation doodad,
	  may still be too small; needs some explanation too

2003-11-05 02:48  speare

	* - reworded, rearranged and adjusted the dialog resources
	  for style and consistency

2003-11-04 00:51  dangelo

	* - added interface to Pano Tools transforms
	  (PT/PanoToolsInterface)
	  - preview with lens distortions
	  
	  - anchor selection window, with strange rotation behavior..
	  have to dissect the transforms and calculate pitch & yaw
	  for new rotation values.
	  Panotools apply rotation before yaw & pitch ->

	  will be extending this to add more smarts in the future. Comments
	  welcome.

	  - display of the panorama state works now
	  - fixed tons of small bugs (display images after one has been
	  added etc.)
	  - listview contains points
	  - TextCtrl's are updated to show the selected Control point.

2003-06-15 20:03  dangelo

	* new notification mechanism:
	  - one panoramaImagesChanged(Panorama &pano, const UIntSet &
	  changed)
	  function. this allows the Panorama to summarize multiple changes
	  without sending incomplete notifications to the observers.

2003-06-13 13:20  beku

	* added some more .cvsignore files, to reduce the noise of the cvs
	  output.

2003-06-12 22:39  dangelo

	* - use DEBUG_TRACE
	  - ImagesPanel uses the specified panorama object and does not
	  create its own.
	  - use add/removeObserver. subcontrols add/remove themself,
	  MainFrame
	  is no longer responsible for forwarding the panoramaChanged()
	  function calls.

2003-06-12 22:33  dangelo

	* added printing of function name to DEBUG_* macros. uses C99
	  compatible __func__
	  instead of the GNU specific __FUNCTION__ macro

2003-06-12 22:30  dangelo

	* - replaced setObserver() with addObserver() and removeObserver()
	  many classes can register themself as observers now.

	  - first version of correlation is added.
	  - adding of images via drag and drop (MainFrame.cpp)
	  shows how to use commands to add an image.
	  
	  - CPEditorPanel doesn't update properly.

2003-06-10 06:23  dangelo

	* added vigra headers.
	  no external libs are needed for the functionality used by hugin.
	  it is taken from vigra 1.1.6.
	  
	  correlation.hxx is new and contains a simple correlation, needs
	  to be extended to work on image pyramids. It probably also
	  contains a
	  bug somewhere, a perfect template doesn't get a correlation
	  coefficent
	  of 1.

2003-06-06 13:51  beku

2003-05-30 10:56  dangelo

	* forgot this..

2003-05-30 10:42  dangelo

	* changes to the build system:
	  o moved hugin application specific data (po files, images etc)
	  into the hugin subdir. I like this more than linking it (doesn't
	  work
	  on windows).
	  o locale_path is not reset to "../po" to the config file all the
	  time.
	  o hugin looks for xrc (and their data) and po files under the
	  current
	  directory. if they can't be found it checks locale_path and
	  xrc_path
	  from the config file / registry
	  o added hand written configure script. maybe its a good idea to
	  create one with autoconf with more checks.

2003-05-30 10:25  dangelo

	* moving po files to hugin/po
