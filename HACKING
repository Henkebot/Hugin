If you want to hack on the hugin project, you'll need to have
the following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.52 or later
	- GNU automake 1.4 or later
	- GNU libtool 1.4 or later
	- GNU gettext 0.11 or later

These should be available by ftp from ftp.gnu.org or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Beta software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

In order to get CVS hugin installed on your system, you need to have
recent versions of the jpeg, png, tiff, zlib, boost, FFTW and wxwidgets 
libraries installed as well. The installation process of these libraries 
is similar to that of hugin, but needs to be fulfilled prior to 
installation of hugin.

To compile a CVS version of hugin on your system, you will need to take
several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these
steps at once by running:

    cvsroot/hugin# ./bootstrap
   
Basically this does the following for you:

    cvsroot/gtk+# gettextize; aclocal; libtoolize; automake; autoheader; autoconf

    The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
    can run the configure script in cvsroot/hugin to create all
    the Makefiles.

Before running bootstrap or configure, make sure you have libtool 
in your path.
