Overview:

These are UNIX only instructions, windows instructions will follow once
hugin is usable on windows.

hugin uses the following libraries. make sure that they are completely
installed (including dev packages)

REQUIRED LIBRARIES/PACKAGES:

 - wxwindows 2.4.0 or higher (libary and development packages)
    hugin uses the XRC extension of wxwindows to build its
    dialogs.

    the XRC extension needs to be installed. You might
    need to install a wxwin-contrib (debian) or similar package if provided
    by your distribution, since most distributions do not include it
    in their default package.
 
    If you compile wxwindows from scratch, go to the contrib/src/xrc folder
    and compile and install xrc from there.

 - make, version 3.8 or higher.
 - gcc (tested with 3.2, 2.95 might also work)

Panorama Tools, get it from

Compilation:

do the following in the hugin directory:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

for wxWindows do following:
$ bzip2 -dv wxGTK-2.4.2.tar.bz2
$ cd wxGTK-2.4.0
$ ./configure --with-gtk --with-opengl
$ make
$ cd contrib
$ ./configure
