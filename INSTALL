Overview:

These are UNIX only instructions, windows instructions will follow once
hugin is usable on windows.

hugin uses the following libraries. make sure that they are completely
installed (including dev packages)

REQUIRED LIBRARIES/PACKAGES:

 - wxwindows 2.4.0 or higher (libary and development packages)
    wxwindows needs to be compiled with the xrc extension. You might
    need to install a wxwin-contrib or similar package if provided
    by your distribution.
 
    If you compile wxwindows from scratch, go to the contrib/src/xrc folder
    and compile and install xrc from there.

 - make, version 3.8 or higher.
 - gcc (tested with 3.2, 2.95 might also work)
