Overview:

qmake from trolltech is used to create the makefiles etc.

hugin uses the following libraries. make sure that they are completely installed (including dev packages)

REQUIRED LIBRARIES/PACKAGES:


Panorama Tools, get it from http://www.path.unimelb.edu.au/~dersch and unpack
it somewhere. Add the Helpers/ subdir to your path.

QT, version 3.1 (it might be rewritten to use only 2.3 features)
libjpeg, version 6b (to read jpeg image properties without loading the whole image)
libexif, version 0.5.9 (to read digital camera information, to calculate the focal length)

lower version numbers of the libs work as well. I'm using debian unstable, so the libs I use tend to be
quite new.

All these libraries must be installed properly and compile without additional
flags. If additional compiler flags are needed, add them to src/hugin.pro.
This is alpha software. If you cant make it compile don't bother using it at the current state.


Compilation:

do the following:
$ cd src
$ qmake
$ make

this will create the hugin binary. copy it somewhere in your path.
