============================
New CMake based build system
============================


Using the CMake build system under Unix
=======================================

briefly, do the following:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .
make
make install

alternatively, you can also do an out of source build, if
you don't want to clutter the hugin source tree with object files etc.

$ cd hugin
$ mkdir mybild
$ cd mybuild
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../
$ make
$ make install


Please report any problems to the hugin-ptx group at google:
http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx

Missing dependencies
=======================
If cmake failed to pick up some dependencies, make sure you have
installed the corresponding development packages (often named:
libjpeg-dev and so on). If cmake still fails to find the libraries,
for example if you have installed them into a non-standart directory,
you can specify the path to libraries and include files using the
ccmake program:
$ cmake .
[some failuer]
$ ccmake .

DEBUG build
===========
Just use:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DWANT_DEBUG=1 ../

For distributors:
=================
CMake supports the DESTDIR variable during make install, this
might be helpful to install into a temporary directory:

$ make install DESTDIR=mytmp_package_dir
