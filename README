Goal: frontend for Panorama Tools, similar
      to PTAssembler, PTGui or Open for Windows.

This package contains two useful programs:

 - hugin, a GUI for the panorama tools suite

 - stitcher, a simple replacement for PTStitcher (doesn't support most
   features of PTStitcher, but is several times faster, opensource and
   will be extended in the future).

hugin can be used to stitch multiple images together. The resulting image can
span 360 degrees. Another common use is the creation of very high resolution
pictures by combining multiple images.

It uses the Panorama Tools (http://www.path.unimelb.edu.au/~dersch/)
as backend, to create high quality images

see our homepage for more information: http://hugin.sf.net

typical use:

1. load images
2. specify initial parameters (lens etc)
3. select control points points.
4. run optimizer to estimate image positions
5. set output parameters and stich images together.

3. might be splitted into
  - move pictures to approxmiate positions with mouse
  - program should search for corrospondances in overlapping regions.

  a completely automatic version would be even better ;)


Knowledge of Panorama Tools is needed to use hugin.
Good introductions are the tutorials from PTGUI and PTAssembler.
The steps are approximately the same.
