WARNING about using PTStitcher.exe:

 PTStitcher.exe might have problems with the pano12.dll file include
 in the installer package.

 If you experience these crashes, rename pano12_for_usage_with_ptstitcher.dll
 to pano12.dll and it should work again. Unfortuantely, this reduces the
 remapping speed by ~30 percent

 See http://www.photocreations.ca/panotools/ for more details.



This package contains the following programs:

 - hugin, The main program, a GUI for the panorama tools suite
   and some programs included here.

 - nona, a simple replacement for PTStitcher (doesn't support most
   features of PTStitcher, but faster, opensource and
   will be extended in the future).
 
 - nona_gui, nona with a graphical progress bar.

 - autooptimiser, optimise a panorama pairwise, starting from an
   anchor image. cmd line version of the pairwise mode in hugin
   
 - panoglviewer, a fast OpenGL accelerated viewer for spherical
   panoramas.

These programs are build on top of the panorama tools library,
http://panotools.sf.net

The following external programs are highly recommended:

1. autopano or autopano-sift
    
hugin can be used to stitch multiple images together. The resulting image can
span 360 degrees. Another common use is the creation of very high resolution
pictures by combining multiple images.

See http://hugin.sf.net for more information an tutorials.

typical use:

1. load images
2. specify initial parameters (lens etc)
3. select control points points.
4. run optimizer to estimate image positions
5. set output parameters and stich images together.
