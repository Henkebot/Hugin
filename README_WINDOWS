Goal: Toolchain to create panoramic images for every occasion,
      from quick holiday snaps to images with hundrets of megapixels.

This package contains the following programs:

 - hugin, The main program, a GUI for the panorama tools suite
   and some programs included here.

 - nona_gui, a simple replacement for PTStitcher (doesn't all
   features of PTStitcher, but is opensource and
   will be extended in the future).

 - panoglviewer, a fast hardware accelerated viewer for spherical
    panoramas.

Please visit the hugin website for documentation and tutorials:

                   http://hugin.sf.net


The following external programs are highly recommended:

1. panotools
2. enblend
3. autopano or autopano-sift
    
hugin can be used to stitch multiple images together. The resulting image can
span 360 degrees. Another common use is the creation of very high resolution
pictures by combining multiple images.

It uses the Panorama Tools (http://www.path.unimelb.edu.au/~dersch/)
as backend, to create high quality images

See our homepage for more information, documentation and tutorials.

typical use:

1. load images
2. specify initial parameters (lens etc)
3. select control points points.
4. run optimizer to estimate image positions
5. set output parameters and stich images together.


Knowledge of Panorama Tools is needed to use hugin.
Good introductions are the tutorials from PTGUI and PTAssembler.
The steps are approximately the same.
