=head1 NAME

align_image_stack - Align overlapping images for HDR creation


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<align_image_stack> [options] I<input> I<files>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

TODO.


=head1 OPTIONS

Modes of operation:

=over

=item B<-p> I<file>

Output .pto file (useful for debugging, or further refinement)

=item B<-a> I<prefix>

Align images, output as prefix_xxxx.tif

=item B<-o> I<output>

Merge images to HDR, generate output.hdr

=back


Modifiers:

=over

=item B<-v>

Verbose, print progress messages. Repeat for higher verbosity

=item B<-e>

Assume input images are full frame fish eye (default: rectilinear)

=item B<-t> I<num>

Remove all control points with an error higher than num pixels
(default: 3)

=item B<-f> I<HFOV>

Approximate horizontal field of view of input images, use if EXIF info
not complete

=item B<-m>

Optimize field of view for all images, except for first. Useful for
aligning focus stacks with slightly different magnification.

=item B<-c> I<num>

Number of control points (per grid) to create between adjacent images
(default: 8)

=item B<-l>

Assume linear input files

=item B<-s> I<scale>

Scale down image by 2^scale (default: 1 [2x downsampling])

=item B<-g> I<gsize>

Break image into a rectangular grid (gsize x gsize) and attempt to
find num control points in each section (default: 5 [5x5 grid])

=item B<-h>

Display help summary.
