External Programs

(This is for 10.4 or above)

HOWTO:
1. Download the source. You typically want to place it in the "ExternalPrograms" folder.
2. Edit ExternalPrograms/scripts/SetEnv-*.txt file appropriately. Especially the myREPOSITORYDIR variable.
3. Open a Terminal window (bash is preferred).
5. 'cd' into the directory of source you want to compile. (eg. 'cd ExternalPrograms/jpeg-6b')
4. Set the variables for the compilation. (eg. 'source ../scripts/SetEnv-universal.txt')
6. Using the appropriate shell script, build the source. (eg. 'sh ../scripts/libjpeg.sh')

RESULT:
The programs and libraries will be installed into $myREPOSITORYDIR, which you can manage independently from the systems you are currently using (e.g /usr, /usr/local, /opt, /sw). Using symbolic links for example, it is possible to share those libraries to be linked with different versions of hugin.
