Tiger utilities.

Tiger comes without subversion and gettext installed. These scripts install:
- gettext: for msgfmt use and as a dependency for subversion
- apr: apache runtime modules for svn 1.5
- apr-util: apache runtime utils for svn 1.5
- libneon: for https support for subversion
- subversion.

Please note that this is a "barebones" subversion. You can't setup a 
local SVN server. It is only for downloading svn based source code from 
Open Source servers.
