The "BP Progress Bar.app" is a stand-alone application and can be used to display either a "progress bar" or a "barber pole"  waiting screen.

The "Enfuse_droplet.app" is NOT a stand-alone program. It needs enfuse, aligne_image_stack and the "BP Progress Bar.app" to reside in the same directory.

Currently the Enfuse_droplet.app is packaged with my stand-alone enblend/enfuse/align_image_stack package.
