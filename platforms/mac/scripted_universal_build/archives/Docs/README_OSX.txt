This is an experimental Hugin 0.7 SVN build for MacOSX.

Please use the latest stable version available from http://hugin.sf.net/ for any deployment. The feedback should be sent to the hugin mailing-list (http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx).


This build is based on Ippei Ukai's work for MacOSX. 
Please read the HOWTO-autopanosift.rtf in the autopano-sift folder carefully!!!
