RELEASE NOTES

this package is highly experimental alpha software.


REQUEST FOR TESTING:

there are two new variations of autopano-sift-c that need testing.
APSC is a standalone C program, while autopano-c-complete.exe is
a compiled Perl script that replicates autopano-c-complete.sh from
the other platforms. autopano-c-complete.vbs is still included for
the record but deprecated.

try with a large number of images. reports success or failure back
to <http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx/>

thank you!


KNOWN ISSUES:
* enfuse zenith and nadir blending


RECENT CHANGES/BUGFIXES:
* installer can now clean hugin's registry entries on install
  but not on uninstall (to avoid removing user's preferences)
* installer can now set some default settings (experimental)
