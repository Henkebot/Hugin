<h3> General questions </h3>

<h4><a href="#top" name="g_mac">Can hugin be used on the Mac?</a></h4>
<p>
  While its shouldn't be too hard to create a Macintosh version,
  none of the core developers uses a Macintosh.
  We are waiting for Mac user with sufficient skills to make the
  necessary (minor) changes to hugin and pano tools.

<h3> Control point selection </h3>

<h4><a href="#top" name="cp_add">How do I add control points?</a></h4>

<p>
  The control point editor is quite powerful, but its usage is
  probably not obvious on the first try. Here are some ways
  the developers use the Control Point panel:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Selecting control points in <b>100%</b> mode. </p>
    <p>
      This method needs some scrolling, if big images are used. You
      might want to try the <b>fit to window</b> zoom setting in that case.
      Switch to the Control Points tab, and use the following settings:
    </p>
<pre>Zoom: 100%
 [X] auto fine tune
 [X] auto add
 [X] auto estimate</pre>
    <ul>
      <li> Click on a prominent feature in the left image.
        If the image pair already contains control points, hugin
        will try to select the point in the other image.
      </li>
      <li> If its the first point in this pair, click near the same
        feature on the right image.
        Otherwise, the second point is placed and fine tuned
        automatically.
      </li>
      <li> If you are not happy with the placement, both points
        can be moved by dragging them to a better position.
        Press the "f" key to fine tune the point in a small area.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p> Selecting control points in <b>fit to window</b> mode. </p>
    <p>
      I uses this mode if I need to set points on big images.
      Switch to the Control Points tab, and use the following settings:
    </p>
<pre>Zoom: fit to window
 [X] auto fine tune
 [ ] auto add
 [X] auto estimate</pre>
    <ul>
      <li> Click on left image. The image is shown in 100% view. </li>
      <li> Within the detailed view, click on a prominent feature.
        If the image pair already contains control points, hugin
        will try to select the point in the other image.
      </li>
      <li> If its the first point in this pair, click near the same
        feature on the right image. The point is placed and
        fine tuned automatically.
      </li>
      <li> If you are not happy with the placement, both points
        can be moved by clicking at the desired
        position. Move the point close to the desired feature
        and press the "f" key to fine tune the point.
      </li>
      <li> When the points are on the same feature, press the
        right mouse button, or press the "a" key to add the
        control point pair. It will then be shown in list
        below the image.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4><a href="#top" name="cp_scroll">How do I scroll both images at the same time?</a></h4>
<p>
  Try pressing the shift key while moving the mouse. The control key
  or the middle mouse button can be used to scroll only the image under
  the mouse cursor
</p>

<h3> Panorama Postprocessing </h3>
<h4><a href="#top" name="pano_gimp_layers">I want to use gimp to tweak the seams of my image, but gimp can't read the PSD?</a></h4>
<p>
  Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a> can't read the PSD files
  generated by PTSticher, and the multiple tiff output it cumbersome to use. There are  two possiblilites to work around this:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use our experimental stitcher, nona, to output to a multiple
        tiff format. Unfortunately I haven't come around to compile a
        windows .exe for it yet, but Alexandre is working on it.
        Just follow the following procedure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p>use hugin to create the panorama project, and choose "Multiple TIFF with mask" as output format. Save the project and start nona on the commandline:</p>
      <pre>$ nona pano_project.pto multi_layer</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This will will produce a multi_layer.tif file, that contains
        all remapped images, cropped to their bounding box. This will
        save a lot of space, compared to a "traditional" PTSticher
        layered output file, where all layers have the full panorama size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, The GIMP 1.2 and 1.3 can't load multilayer TIFF files.
        You have to download and compile an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=859181&amp;group_id=77506&amp;atid=550443">updated tiff plugin</a>.
        It has been tested with GIMP 1.2 and GIMP 1.3.22.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If this is to cumbersome or you need PTSticher features not
        supported by nona, you can also use <a href="http://www.vierpi.de/tif2xcf.html">tif2xcf</a>, to combine the multiple TIFF output into a multilayer XCF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important: PTSticher does not create the output files, if the output file
        contains an .tif extension. So, specify only the basename,
        without the extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately this wastes tons of memory because it stores
        each remapped image in a layer with the size of the final
        panorama.
        </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
