<h1>hugin Manual</h1>

<p>A easy to use GUI for <a href="http://www.path.unimelb.edu.au/~dersch/">Panorama Tools</a>.</p>

<p>Hugin currently supports most features of panorama tools, and can be
used for to create different kinds of panoramic images.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This is the reference manual (hah, good joke... :-) for hugin. It
does not cover general panorama creation, but tries to document
keyboard shortcuts and other things that are not obvious from the first
look at the interface.  </p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://hugin.sf.net">hugin homepage</a> contains more
  general information and even some tutorials.

<p>Thanks to all people on the ptx mailing list, for many interesting
ideas and for testing.</p>

<h2>IMPORTANT BUG WARNING</h2>
<p>
  Currently, changes to the text fields have to be confirmed by
  pressing enter or by selecting another GUI element (press tab or
  click somewhere else). Unfortunately on some platforms only one
  variation works.
</p>

<h2>Main Window</h2>

<p> This window consists of a toolbar that provides quick access to
important functions. It also contains the Images, Lens, Control Point,
Optimizer and Panorama Tab, which will be explained below.</p>

<h3>Images Tab</h3>

<p> Images can either be added with the <b>Add</b> button, or via drag
and drop. To change the orientation of one or more images, select them
in the list on the left. The image will be show in the preview area, and
its orientation (yaw, pitch and roll values) can be edited on the left.
</p>

<p> It is possible to select multiple images at the same time. Changes
  in orientation will be applied to all selected images
</p>

<h3>Lens Tab</h3>
<p>
  The lens tab looks a lot like the Images tab, except that the lens settings
  can be edited here. As in the Images Tab, multiselection can be used
  to change the parameters for multiple images.
</p>

<p>
  Currently only one lens is supported. The idea is that the Lens
  describes the process that was used to create the image. The most
  important parameters are the <b>Lens type</b> and the <b>HFOV</b>
  (Horizontal Field of View). Hugin will read the EXIF information in
  jpg files created by digital cameras, so usually it is filled out
  correctly.
</p>

<p>
  Photographers do not use a HFOV in degrees, but the focal
  length. The focal length can be entered and it will be converted to
  HFOV in degrees, like the panorama tool require it. The focal length
  entered is taken to be for 35 mm film cameras.
</p>

<p>
  Usually images are more or less distorted. This can be seen especially
  if there are long straight lines close to the image border, which
  are usually not completely straight but bent a little. The <b>a</b>
  <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> parameters are used to remove that distortion.
  They are applied radially from the image center, which can be moved by
  changing the <b>d</b> and <b>e</b> parameters.
</p>

<p>
  During image capture, it is possible that the parameters vary, that is
  are not the same for each image. This can have many reasons, one of
  the could be a scanner that cuts a way a few pixel more at one side
  than the other. Other parameters stay the same, like usually the a,b and c
  parameters (if the zoom and focus for the images is the same).
  </p>
<p>
  The <b>inherit</b> checkmark means that this parameter doesn't vary
  between the images that were captures with that lens setting. If a
  parameter is inheritied it is forced to be the same for all images.
  When inherited parameters are optimized they are kept the same for
  all images, whereas parameters that are not inherited can get values
  specific for a single picture.
</p>

<h3>Control Point Tab</h3>

<p>
  Control Points are probably the most important thing when using
  panorama tools.
</p>

<p>
  The Tab consists of two image displays and tab bars to switch images
  to be editied. The bottom contains a list view where Points can be
  selected and some fields to edit a selected point. Points can also
  be selected by clicking or dragging on them in the images. It is
  possible to zoom out to show the full image.
</p>

<p>
  Adding a control point works by clicking into one image to select a point
  and then into the other image. If <b>auto add</b> is not set, the
  points can be moved by clicking at some other place in the images.
  They are added to the list of control points by pressing the <b>right
  mouse button</b>. If you press the right mouse button when only one
  point is slected, the point selection will be aborted. <b>auto
  add</b> adds the control point as soon as both points have been specified.
</p>

<p>
  Control point creation is influenced by the following checkboxes:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>auto fine tune</b> hugin helps you to find the second point
      by looking for it in a search region (shown by a rectange around
      the cursor). This might not always work, but usually is reliable,
      if the image distortions are not too big. Try and play with it.
    </li>
    <li> <b>auto add</b> A control point is automatically added when both
      points are know. You won't have time to refine the selection
      before adding the point.
    </li>
    <li> <b>auto estimate</b> Tries to estimate the position of the
      second point by estimating the translation between the two images.
      This is very crude and probably only works for single row panoramas
      created from rectilinear images.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  All these flags can be combined. I typically use <b>auto fine tune</b> and
  <b>auto estimate</b> at the same time. Then hugin usually
  automatically selects the second point correctly. Well for single
  row panos that is...
</p>

<p>
  The images are zoomed out, the first click zooms to a temporary 100%
  view to give you the chance to refine your selection. Note that only
  the second click will trigger the auto estimate.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Fine Tune</b> button can be used to find a better position
  for the point in the right image for already selected
  point. Contrary to <b>auto fine tune</b> it only looks in a very
  small area around the point.
  This function is especially useful if you moved both points by hand, but
  want to have fine tuned control points.
</p>

<p>
  Press the <b>middle mouse button</b> to pan the image. If you press
  <b>shift key</b> while paning, both images will move.
</p>

<p>
  This window supports some keyboard shortcuts:
</p>

  <table summary="">
    <tr> <th> Key </th> <th> Function </th> </tr>
    <tr> <td> a </td> <td> add a new point that has been selected in both images, and the <b>auto add</b> is switched off. </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> cursor keys </td> <td> scroll image under the mouse cursor </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> shift + cursor keys </td> <td> scroll both images at the same time </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> f </td> <td> fine tune currently selected control point pair. Same as the <b>Fine Tune</b> button </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> Del </td> <td> Remove currently selected control point. </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> Zoom out to full view. </td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 100% view. </td> </tr>
  </table>

  <table summary="">
    <tr> <th> Mouse function </th> <th> Function </th> </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> control key + mouse movement </td>
      <td> Scroll image under cursor </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> shift key + mouse movement </td>
      <td> Scroll both images </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> left button </td>
      <td> Use left mouse button to select new points or drag existing
        points.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> right mouse button </td>
      <td> Add control point, if <b>auto add</b> is switched off </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> middle mouse button </td>
      <td> Scroll image under cursor </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> shift + middle mouse button </td>
      <td> Scroll both images </td>
    </tr>
  </table>


<h3>Optimizer Tab</h3>
<p>
  The optimizer moves the images into the right position, so that they
  can be assembled into a hopefully seamless panorama.
</p>

<p>
  To select what the optimiser should try to estimate, use the <b>Optimize</b>
  combo box, then click the <b>Optimize</b> Button.

  If you select the "custom" setting, you can change
</p>

<h3>Pano Panel</h3>
<p>
Options concerning the output panorama can be set here.
FIXME, write some more...
