<a name="Panorama"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Panorama </span></h2>
<p>Panoramas are an exciting, creative application of photography and recently, of computing. Panoramas 
offer a unique, immersive perspective to the viewer. To the photographer, panoramas present an interesting artistic and technical challenge, both from the point of view of obtaining the source images, and processing and presenting the final panoramic product.
</p>
<a name="Definition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Definition </span></h3>
<p>Panoramas come in different shapes and flavors. A <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/panorama" class="external text" title="http://www.wordreference.com/definition/panorama" rel="nofollow">dictionary</a> tells us a panorama is "a picture (or series of pictures) representing a continuous scene". This continuous scene can come straight from a (special) camera or it can be assembled from multiple images using special software such as the <a href="Panorama_tools.html" title="Panorama tools">panorama tools</a>.
</p><p>Technically two different types of panoramas are distinguished.
</p>
<a name="Partial_panoramas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Partial panoramas </span></h3>
<p>If a partial Panorama doesn't come from a special <a href="http://wiki.panotools.org/wiki/index.php?title=Panorama_Camera&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Panorama Camera">Panorama Camera</a> it typically is an image created by assembling together 2 or more images to create a single image with a wider <a href="Field_of_View.html" title="Field of View">Field of View</a>.
</p><p>Partial panoramas are created in exactly the same way as full spherical panoramas, but cover only a fraction of the view sphere (less than 360 degrees in longitude around the horizon, and/or less than 180 degrees in latitude).  Example partial panos include <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/gigapixel.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/gigapixel.htm" rel="nofollow">Max Lyon's GigaPixel image</a>, created with 196 source images!  Partial panoramas are often viewed like traditional images, either in print or digital form.
</p>
<a name="Immersive_panoramas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Immersive panoramas </span></h3>
<p>Immersive or <i>full-spherical</i> panoramas are panoramas viewed through <a href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Panorama_Viewers" title="Panorama Viewers">special viewing software</a> that allows you to look everywhere around you, including straight up and straight down.    Partial panoramas can also be viewed in the same way, blurring the difference between them.  In particular, partial panoramas which cover all 360 degrees in longitude, but less than 180 degrees of latitude, are often considered immersive panoramas as well, and viewed with the same type of software.  Example immersive panoramas can be found at the <a href="http://geoimages.berkeley.edu/wwp/" class="external text" title="http://geoimages.berkeley.edu/wwp/" rel="nofollow">World-Wide Panorama page</a>, among many other places.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<a name="Projection"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Projection </span></h3>
<p>A fundamental concept in the production and viewing of both partial and full spherical panoramic images is the type of input and output projection used.  See <a href="Projections.html" title="Projections">Projections</a> for more information.  It is the projection of photographic images and resulting panoramas which explains why the simple method of aligning and taping together snapshots cannot produce seamless panoramic images (though it can be quite enjoyable in its own right).
