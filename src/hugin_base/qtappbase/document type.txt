document type

formal identifier for document types/formats

Probably the best candidate be:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/understanding_utis/index.html

We can use our own system however, so subset of three letter extension or MIME type or can be pretty much anything.

Examples:

UTI
 public.plain-text
 |- net.sourceforge.panotools.ptoptimiser-script
	|- net.sourceforge.hugin.hugin-project-v1

MIME
 text/plain
 |- application/x-ptoptimizer-script
    |- application/x-hugin-projectv1

Extension 
.pto
