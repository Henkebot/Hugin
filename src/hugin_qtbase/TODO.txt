hugin_qtbase [TODO]

!!! obviously implementations not at all complete !!!
... in fact, it's just started.

 Please take a look at any of those classes and give it a life.



Aside from implementing classes and finalising the headers, it would be nice to have something like TextEditor domo using qtappbase. Anyway, this is very early stage of development.
