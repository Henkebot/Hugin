Test suite for feature detectors
================================

Downloaded from:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/index.html

The test suite has been ported to run on octave and scripts
to compare different feature detectors have been extended.

Read the above website (especially the papers) for more
information about the tests and the meaning of the graphs.

Installation
============================================

For running the tests, download the Test data packages from
the above mentioned website and place each of them in a
subdirectory of this directory.

compile the required mex files:

$ octave
> mex descdist.cpp
> mex c_eoverlap.cpp

The scripts depend on mser.ln from
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/index.html
and SURF from http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~surf/
matchpoint from the hugin repository and a modified
version of panomatic, which outputs suitable descriptors.

If you don't have these, you can disable some of them by
adjusting repeatability_demo.m and descperf_demo.m

Running the detector tests
==========================

$ octave
> repeatability_demo

This will produce a set of graphs showing the performance
on the different test sets.


Running the descriptor tests
============================
$ octave
> repeatability_demo

This will produce a set of graphs showing the performance
on the different test sets.
