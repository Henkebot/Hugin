Hugin windows compilation with Visual Studio.NET 2003

A step by step guide

0. Decision
   
   At startup, you have to choose if you want the runtime library statically linked or dynamically link.
   When decided, you have to compile every project with the same settings.
   Let says it's dynamically linked (best performance in wxWindows)

1. Compilation of wxWindows
 
   WARNING : read carefully this, it will not work if not :
     In every dsp files from wxWindows, you have to check 2 properties lines
      "C/C++/Preprocessor/Preprocessors Definitions" : If _MT or _DLL is defined, remove them
      "C/C++/Code Generation/Runtime Library" : 
         - for debug   : Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MTd)
         - for release : Multi-threaded DLL (/MT) 
   
   - Grab the latest package at www.wxwindows.org
     Name : wxMSW-2.4.2-setup.zip, extract and install.
   - In the yourpath\Windows-2.4.2\src, open the wxWindows.dsp into visual studio 
   - save the sln file project
   - build the solution : choose the right configuration you want : debug / release, static / linked, ansi / unicode
     for hugin : Static / Ansi / ( debug or release )
   - go to contrib\src\xrc and open the XrcVC.dsp
     -> save the .sln file 
   - compile with desired configuration DLL / (Debug | Release)
   In yourpath\Windows-2.4.2\lib, you should at least have :
      wxmsw.lib or wxmswd.lib (for wxWindows DLL release or debug)
      wxxrc.lib or wxxrcd.lib
   - Then you should do the same with the following libraries : jpeg, png, zlib, tiff, regex
      You should get jpegd.lib (for debug), jpeg.lib (for release), etc
     => take care also here that the project properties are correct
    
2. Compilation of Pano12.dll

   I used the max-lyon release : Look at here : http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm
   
   You should have this project compiled with visual. I provide the right sln file for doing it.
   I put the code in the pano12 folder near jhead. I do not provide source code but you will find
   the files which have differences from Max's release.

   => the output of the compilation : pano12.dll, pano12.lib (in either debug or release folder) 

3. Compilation of hugin

   => open hugin.sln and compile
