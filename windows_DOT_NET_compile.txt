How to compile hugin on windows, using Microsoft Visual Studio.Net (2003)

1. download wxWidgets 2.6.0, from http://www.wxwidgets.org
2. download boost            from http://www.boost.org
3. download panorama tools source and .dll file, from http://panotools.sf.net

4. unpack everything so that the following directory is created:

  hugin                  <- hugin sourcecode
  libs/wxWidgets         <- wxwidgets, remove version number from directory name
  libs/boost             <- boost, remove version number from directory name

  libs/panotools/pano12  <- pano tools sourcecode, together with
                            pano12.lib

5. Open libs/wxWidgets/src/tiff/tiffconf.h in your favorite editor, and
   add
   #define ZIP_SUPPORT
   near line 90 to support ZIP compressed tiff files

6. build wxWidgets: start the msvc command line shell (from the startmenu)
   and execute the following commands
     cd hugin/utils
     build_wxwin_msvc.bat

   This should build wxWidgets.

7. Build boost library (refer to the boost documentation for details).
    overview: download bjam exectable from 
    http://www.boost.org/tools/build/v1/build_system.htm
    and place it in the boost directory. Open the MSVC Command line prompt
    and change directory to the boost dir and issue:
       bjam stage

7. Open hugin/src/Hugin.sln and compile.
